# Angular5-With-SpringBoot-Application-poc
This is a sample project using Angular 5 and Spring Boot. Spring boot has been used to expose REST Endpoints and the client is written in angular.  This is a complete web application with a connectivity to mysql database. I have used Spring Data to connect to the database and perform CRUD operation.
